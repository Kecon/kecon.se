				<h2 class="align-center">In short</h2>
				<p>I've always been interested in computers since I received a
					computer in my room in 1990. I liked playing computer games and
					that made me interested in programming and learned C when I was 13.
					I had the luck to get a job at TeleTalk (today Link Mobility AB)
					during my last year in in high school. I developed IVR-services in
					their own developed programming language TeleTalk for the first
					years.</p>
				<p>I did military service at S1, Enköping during 2001 as a
					computer operator in a platoon that build staff locations. I
					learned to build network (cable, configuring Cisco, routing,
					IT-security, etc.), which I've had benefits of at Link Mobility,
					where I've had part time maintenance of servers and been
					responsible for it since 2007. I have been employed at Link
					Mobility since 2002 (TeleTalk, Doera Service Provider, Telenor
					Link, Link Messaging) and before that worked hourly since September
					1999.</p>
				<p>I started to develop in Java in 2001, and it has been my
					"first language" since then, but I've also written some in C, C++,
					PHP and Python. I've been working in a quite small organisation
					during the past 10 years and I've had a couple of different tasks
					such as design, development, server maintenance, support, technical
					sales support and project management.</p>
				<p>I started Kendanware in 2014 together with an old friend that
					I meet at Najt which was a LAN party organisation where I was
					chairman of the board and had other positions between 1999 and
					2006.</p>

				<h2 class="align-center">Link Mobility, Common Layer, 2012-2020</h2>
				<p>Link Mobility has acquired several SMS-companies over the
					past years and received a couple of similar SMS-systems, but
					decided in 2013 develop a new common API to handle SMS, e-mail,
					payments, address lookups etc, to reduce the amount of system and
					then migrate all legacy systems towards the new Common Layer.</p>
				<p>The new API is REST based using JSON. The main focus has been
					performance and high availability. Testing and code review has been
					important in the project since the new system will handle millions
					of transactions each day.</p>
				<p>My responsibility in the Common Layer project has been to
					create a new API, collect and compile demands of different
					platforms, develop components and project manage the Swedish parts
					of the project (co-owned project together with the head quarter in
					Oslo).</p>

				<h2 class="align-center">Link Mobility, SMSC, 2007-2020</h2>
				<p>Link Mobility has been a SMS supplier since 2000, but decided
					in 2007 to develop an own SMSC for better performance, high
					availability, lower costs and perform better support towards
					customers. The platform was integrated directly to operator's
					SMSC:s using different protocols such as SMPP, CIMD2, UCP and a
					couple of other proprietary protocols via SOAP or REST.</p>
				<p>The platform is connected towards all operators in Sweden and
					Norway (estimated market share of 40% in Norway). Most operators
					are connected in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Denmark.
					Other aggregators is also using the platform for delivering
					messages using direct connections.</p>
				<p>SMS payments was integrated into the platform in 2010 for
					Sweden, but has since then also been integrated towards operators
					in Norway and the Baltics.</p>
				<p>SMSC is designed using redundant nodes that may be updated
					during operation without affecting traffic. The main focus as been
					high availability, but also that is must be able to handle several
					thousands transactions per seconds during peek hours, such as TV
					votes or SMS-advertising where millions of recipients must have
					their message before lunch.</p>
				<p>The SMSC is working as a cluster deployed in different
					datacenters with nodes in Stockholm, Frankfurt, Madrid, Oslo and
					Hamburg.</p>
				<p>My responsibility in the project has been to design a
					scalable and redundant platform and integrate towards different
					operators. I've also been project manager for integrating and
					migrate operator connections from other platform that Link Mobility
					has acquired over the years. I'm the System Architect and 
					Product Owner for the project since 2020</p>

				<h2 class="align-center">WyWallet, Proxy, 2012</h2>
				<p>WyWallet was created as the mobile payment provider in Sweden
					by the four largest operators in 2012. I received the task to write
					a proxy server that was in front of all the four operators payment
					API:s, which means that the proxy server emulated each operator's
					SOAP interface and choose to send transactions to WyWallet if both
					the customer and the service were registered in WyWallet, and
					otherwise towards the operator. The proxy server was online for 24
					months to give mobile aggregators more time to migrate from old
					direct operator connections towards WyWallet. The majority of all
					SMS payments in Sweden was sent through the proxy server during the
					second half of 2012.</p>
				<p>The service required high availability and there were 40
					existing connections that shouldn't be affected by connecting
					towards the proxy, and it was of great importance that all requests
					and responses were looking exactly as the original service.</p>
				<p>I was the main developer, architect and responsible for the
					project. I was responsible to build a new environment with new
					hardware and redundant load balancers, and develop a redundant
					solution that could handle large amount of traffic, such as
					Melodifestivalen and Eurovision Song Contest.</p>
